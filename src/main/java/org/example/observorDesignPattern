Observer Design Pattern(Join used in monolithic architecture)
      The Observer Design Pattern is a behavioral pattern that establishes a one-to-many dependency between objects,
      such that when one object changes its state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
      It is commonly used in situations where an object (the subject) needs to notify multiple other objects (the observers) about changes in its state.
